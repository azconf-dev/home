# AzConf Registration

AzConf organizers have decided to go with [Townscript](https://www.townscript.com) to manage registrations, ticket sales, payment and event-day check in and has the lowest processing charges.

## Tickets

Townscript enables us to customize the registration form and therefore get more granular reporting on things like food preferences, gender and T-shirt sizes to name some. We create multiple ticket categories

- **Paid Tickets**
  - Early Bird Tickets
  - Regular Tickets
  - Bulk Registration

- **Free tickets**
  - Organizers
  - Speakers
  - Volunteers
  - {Sponsor_Name} - Sponsored

For the inaugural AzConf, a ticket gives you access to all the days and all the tracks of the conference. We don't plan to sell separate tickets for individual days of the conference. **Workshops tickets are separate**.

## Registration Form

The event registration form must have the following questions

- First Name (Mandatory)
- Last Name (Mandatory)
- Email Address (Mandatory)
- Gender (Mandatory)
- Job Title
- Company / Organization
- Food Preferences (Mandatory)
  - Veg / Non-Veg / Vegan / Gluten-Free
- T Shirt Size (Mandatory)
  - S / M / L / XL / XXL etc.

## Refund Policy and Update Registration Details

**No refunds are available**

The attendees are welcome to send someone else in their place and transfer tickets through the Townscript website. In order to facilitate this process, we configure townscript to allow "Transfer of Tickets". Additionally, we also configure townscript to allow attendees to update details after registration in the rare chance that we decide to collect additional information later. This allows people to login to Townscript and update their registration details.

## Attendee Instructions (on ticket / post registration ??)

- Avoid printing the ticket and please bring us the ticket on your mobile device or laptop when you arrive. Keep an offline copy of the ticket like a screenshot of the ticket in case the internet decides to go crazy on you on event day.

## Message to be displayed on PDF ticket

If you registered on behalf on someone else or a group of people, please make sure their details are correct. We would like to have the name and email of each participant and not just the name of person who made a group purchase.
