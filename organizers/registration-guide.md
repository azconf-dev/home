# Az Conf Registration

We have decided to go with [Townscript](https://www.townscript.com) to manage registrations, ticket sales, payment and event-day check in.

## Tickets

Townscript enables us to customize the registration form and therefore get more granular reporting on things like food preferences, gender and T-shirt sizes to name some. We create multiple ticket categories like

- **Paid Tickets**
  - Early Bird Tickets
  - Regular Tickets
  - Bulk Registration

- **Free tickets**
  - Organizers
  - Speakers
  - Volunteers
  - {Sponsor_Name} - Sponsored

For the inaugural Az Conf, a ticket gives you access to all the days and all the tracks of the conference. We don't plan to sell separate tickets for individual days of the conference. **Workshops tickets if any are separate**.

## Registration Form

The event registration form must have the following questions

- First Name (Mandatory)
- Last Name (Mandatory)
- Email Address (Mandatory)
- Gender (Mandatory)
- Job Title
- Company / Organization
- Food Preferences (Mandatory)
  - Veg / Non-Veg / Vegan / Gluten-Free
- T Shirt Size (Mandatory)
  - S / M / L / XL / XXL etc.

## Registration Policy

- No refunds are available except if they are selected as a speaker but the attendees are welcome to send someone else in their place and transfer tickets through the Townscript website. In order to facilitate this process, we configure townscript to allow "Transfer of Tickets". Additionally, we also configure townscript to allow attendees to update details after registration in the rare chance that we decide to collect additional information later.

- If you registered on behalf on someone else or a group of people, please make sure their details are correct. We would like to have the name and email of each participant and not just the name of person who made a group purchase.
