# Date and Venue Selection

We try and run the event roughly the same time each year (late June) which is Australian wintertime. Additionally we try to avoid any major conferences or events happening at the same time.

# Promotion of event

We promote the event by emailing previous attendees, twitter, user groups/talks and word of mouth.

## Organizers Goodies

- Clothing takes time to print. Obtain a sample, get sizing of organisers and speakers asap and submit your order in plenty of time.

- We have tended to print t-shirts for speakers - its a nice gift & helps promote the event and hoodies for volunteers this makes them easily identifiable and can carry sponsors logos.
