# Speaker Selection Process

With this article we want to give you some more insights on our speaker selection process and how we build the agenda.

AzConf is a 2 day conference with 4 (might change) tracks. Each track is expected to have about 10 talks each. That makes it a total of 40 sessions.

As the inaugural event, we have decided to fill around 50% of talks by inviting "known, regular speakers". These speakers will be a good balance of local / international conference speakers and people who are a regular in the meetup scene and are ready to level up. We then create a CFP through [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com) for the remaining 50% of the talks (20 slots). We recommend that you submit a maximum of 3 talks and not your entire portfolio.

The agenda committee has to pick 20 talks from all the talks submitted. Not an easy thing and your selection / rejection depends on many reasons as [explained brilliantly by Dylan Beattie](https://medium.com/@dylanbeattie/why-your-talk-wasnt-picked-for-ndc-9f19366d8a43). While the initial rounds of the evaluation process is anonymized, when it comes down to the final rounds and especially when there are multiple talks on the same topic, we look at the speaker profile and consider why they are the right person to speak about it. We strive for an agenda that is attractive to the attendees and fair to all the people who submitted.

This means after the evaluation is over, we categorize the submissions in 3 categories.

- Declined
- Accepted (20)
- Wait List (10)

We first send out decline emails to those who submitted. Including a detailed explanation of the reasons behind this decision is not a feasible reality for the agenda committee and we hope you will understand this. Please do not take this personal !! We did not decline you as a person, we declined your session in this conference after comparing with other submissions. Please continue to submit in our future events and other conferences. Good Luck.

We then send out accepted email and in the process we might receive emails from speakers that they have other engagements and can't make it here. That is ok and as organizers we fall back into the wait list category and therefore submissions in the wait list category might recieve their accept / reject emails slightly later.
