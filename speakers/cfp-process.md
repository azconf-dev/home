# Speaker Selection Process

Az Conf is a 2 day conference with multiple tracks. Each track is expected to have about 10 talks each over the course of 2 days.

As the inaugural event, we have decided to fill around 50% of talks by inviting "known, regular speakers". These speakers will be a good balance of local / international conference speakers and people who are a regular in the local meetup scene and are ready to level up. We choose the remaining 50% of the talks via a CFP through [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com).

While the initial rounds of the evaluation process is anonymized, when it comes down to the final rounds and especially when there are multiple talks on the same topic, we look at the speaker profile and consider who is are the right person to speak about it.

This means after the evaluation is over, the submissions end-up in 3 categories.

- Declined
- Accepted (20)
- Wait List (10)

We first send out decline emails to those who submitted. Including a detailed explanation of the reasons behind this decision is not feasible for the agenda committee and we hope you will understand this. Please, please do not take this personal !! We did not decline you as a person, we declined your session in this conference after comparing with other submissions. Please continue to submit in our future events and other conferences. We would love to host you at our local monthly meetups and maybe next year you can be on the invited guests next year.

We then send out accepted email and in the process we might receive emails from speakers that they have other engagements and can't make it here. That is ok and as organizers we fall back into the wait list category and therefore submissions in the wait list category might recieve their accept / reject emails slightly later.

## Speaker Prep

After your submission is accepted, we invite you to a slack workspace and then we team up speakers and they prepare for the talks. We would ideally team people with different experience levels but similar interests where each team can have check-points for preparation and thereby all speakers are prepared well in advance.
