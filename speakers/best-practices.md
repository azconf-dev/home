- Keep a copy of the presentation material in a USB flash drive. So it can be used in case the internet fails.
- Update the **Speaker Info** section of your proposal with a few lines about you that may be used for announcements
- Speakers need to sign an undertaking for recording and distribution - please sign it when you reach the venue. The content can be previewed [here](https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon2019-tasks/wiki/Undertaking-for-recording-and-distribution).

### Inclusive

- For the benefit of visually impaired attendees in the audience, presenters are recommended that all slides, videos and visual demos be described in speech.
- Please use English as the language for the presentation. Since the audience is pan India and even international, this is the best choice.
