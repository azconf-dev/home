# Speakers FAQ

## Travel and Accommodation Expenses

- We ask if your employer can cover your travel and stay expenses as an effort to keep ticket costs low. If that is not possible, we will cover your travel and stay expenses.

- We pay for your plane / train tickets (economy) and while we are happy to assist you with the bookings, we recommend that you plan / arrange your own flights. The main issue is that once a lot of people are involved (speaker, organizers, travel company), email communication can become a nightmare. The idea is to have an arrangement where we give you an amount for travel and you can manage the rest.

- We book and pay for your accommodation for the full length of conference plus at least an extra day.

## Speaker Honorarium

- At this moment, we **are not able** to pay the speakers an honorarium. If this changes in future and we are able to pay an honorarium, we will do so for all speakers and we will pay equally.

- As a speaker, you get a free-pass to the whole conference.

## Inclusive Space

- We ensure to put together a inclusive speaker line-up / panel where everyone feels welcome. You can help us in the process by sharing the stage and / or asking someone from an under-represented group to submit to the CFP.

- We have a [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect everyone to adhere to. If for any reason the conference, other speakers, sponsors, attendees, third-party vendors, etc become problematic ( which you reserve the right to determine ), you have the right to withdraw from the conference at any point. We hope you never have to exercise this right. In most situations, we are confident that we can collaborate to find an effective, less dire solution to the problem.

- There will be a speaker room / quiet spaces in the venue where you can re-energize.

- The conference venue and the associated spaces will be accessible. This includes the conference venue, stage, hotel and networking spaces. Check our [accessibility guide](../general/ACCESSIBILITY.md).

## The stage is all yours

- The talks are usually approximately 45 minutes long. You will be provided with a 16:9 projector, slide switcher, international adapters, HDMI, VGA, USB-C cables, confidence monitors, a wearable microphone and flexibility to use your own slides templates and your own laptop that you are comfortable with.

- Your talk will be recorded and later be published online (with speakers retaining copyright) and **not** be behind a paywall. This requires that you agree to a [speaker undertaking form](./speaker-undertaking.md). You can of-course opt out of being recorded / published.

- We strongly recommend you take questions separately in the hallway because **"science"**. Let us explain

  - As a speaker, you were amazing on stage and finished strongly. The "thank you" slide comes on and there is a big round of applause. Ta-Da !! Now you can leave on a high note. Q&A here only drags it down from here.

  - Other attendees are likely not interested in Q&A and maybe vacating the rooms. You are having a awkward conversation where you are on stage and can barely see the person asking you a question while a good portion of the room might be moving out.
  
  - You might have questions like "but this other library does that". But that is not really a question and it creates an awkward moment. Questions in the hallway are carefully thought of and will be more thoughtful.

  - And you finish QA at the lowest point. "Any more questions? no? ok.. awkward silence.. I guess that's it".
