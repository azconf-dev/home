# Sponsorship Guide

At AzConf, we strive to keep the ticket costs relatively low through **"responsible sponsorships"**. Sponsorship prospectus will be made available soon.

## Responsible Sponsorships

- Sponsors are required to adhere to the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which extends to the logo, social media campaigns, kit inserts, swag and the booth. Size restrictions apply to the pull-up banners and the kit inserts must be pre-approved by the organizers to avoid repetition of items.

- Participant details will not be shared without their explicit permission. Participants can share their information with you at your stall and all sponsors are free to collect details.

## Promoting Yourself

- Sponsors can raffle out few tickets via social media, and it is usually extremely popular.

- Giveaways are another great way to promote your company brand. Sponsors can run online contests prior to the conference and the prize winners can be declared on the day of the conference.
