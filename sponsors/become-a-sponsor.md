# Sponsorship Guide

At AzConf, we strive to keep the ticket costs relatively low through **"responsible sponsorships."** Sponsorship prospectus will be made publicly available soon.

## Responsible Sponsorships

- Sponsors are required to adhere to the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which extends to the logo, social media campaigns, kit inserts, swag and the booth. Size restrictions apply to the pull-up banners and kit inserts must be pre-approved by the organizers.

- Participant details will not be shared without their explicit permission. Participants can share their information with you at your stall and all sponsors are free to collect details.

- Sponsors of selected tiers are eligible for a single speaking slot through a separate CFP process exclusive for sponsors. Each sponsor can submit a maximum of 3 talks and agenda committee picks the talk that best suits the conference agenda.

## Promote yourself and the conference

- If you are promoting the conference on social media, please use the hashtag #azconf2020.

- Sponsors raffle out few tickets via social media, and it is usually extremely popular.

- Giveaways are another great way to promote your company brand. Sponsors can run online contests prior to the conference and the prize winners were declared on the day of the conference.
