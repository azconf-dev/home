# Sponsorship Guide

At AzConf, we strive to keep the ticket costs relatively low through **"responsible sponsorships."** You can read our sponsorship prospectus at <<>>.

## Responsible Sponsorships

- Sponsors of selected tiers are eligible for stage time / speaking slots through a separate CFP process exclusive for sponsors. Each sponsor can submit a maximum of 3 talks and agenda committee picks the talk that best suits the conference agenda.

- Each sponsor is eligible for a maximum of 1 slot and there will be 4 slots in total reserved for sponsors. Sponsors irrespective of sponsorship band are welcome to submit talks via the general CFP process as well and go through the regular selection process.

- Most importantly, sponsors are required to adhere to the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which extends to the logo, social media campaigns, kit inserts, swag and the booth. Size restrictions apply to the pull-up banners / kit inserts and all items must be pre-approved by the organizers.
