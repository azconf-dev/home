# About AzConf

We saw the need of a conference

- Catering to a general web / cloud and other development technologies.
- Non-profit and community driven.
- With the right balance of local / international speakers.

and so we decided to do it..

The conference is an initiative by [Azure User Group Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Bangalore/) and will be scaled / supported by other tech communities in Bangalore. The Azure UG has hosted Global Azure Bootcamp (5 tracks) thrice with approx 500 attendees each time and other similar events and we are ready to level up.

**[AzConf 2020](https://www.azconf.dev/)** will be a 2 day multi-track conference at Bangalore, India with an extra day for workshops on Cloud and Web Development with open source and cloud native technologies while gently leaning towards the Microsoft Stack. We expect an audience count of 800+ people primarily from Bangalore but also pan India. AzConf will be a not-for-profit, community driven conference by developers for developers with talks on the following list of (non-exhaustive) topics.

- .NET and Azure.
- DevOps and Continuous Delivery.
- Cloud Native Technologies.
- Javascript and Web Development.
- Life Hacks / Career / Work Skills.
- IoT, Open Source Hardware.
