# About AzConf

We saw the need of a conference

- Catering to developers working web / cloud and related technologies.
- Non-profit and community driven.
- With the right balance of local / international speakers.

and so we decided to do it..

The conference is an initiative by [Azure User Group Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Bangalore/) and will be scaled / supported by other tech communities in Bangalore. The Azure UG has hosted Global Azure Bootcamp thrice with approx 500 attendees and 5 parallel tracks each time and we are ready to level up.

The conference is aimed at Cloud and Web Developers working with open source and cloud native technologies gently leaning towards the Microsoft Stack. We expect an audience count of 800+ developers from India. There will be a pre-day workshop on June 17th.
